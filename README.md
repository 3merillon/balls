# 2D Ball Physics Simulator

## Overview

This project is a 2D Physics Simulator featuring realistic ball physics with gravity, drag, and the Magnus effect. The simulator includes interactive sliders for adjusting various parameters, CSS3 animated buttons, and a play/pause button with generative music.

## Features

- Realistic ball physics with gravity and drag
- Magnus effect for rotating balls
- Interactive sliders for adjusting gravity, air density, drag coefficient, and rotational drag
- CSS3 animated buttons
- Play/pause button with generative music

## Demo

## Usage

### Controls

- **Spawn Ball**: Click the "spawn ball" button to add a new ball to the simulation.
- **Drag Balls**: Drag and throw the balls to observe the physics.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to adjust gravity, air density, drag coefficient, and rotational drag.
- **Play/Pause Music**: Click the play/pause button to start or stop the generative music.
- **Volume Control**: Use the volume slider to adjust the music volume.
